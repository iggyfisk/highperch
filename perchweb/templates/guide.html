                <div class="cont">
                    <p>My Battle.net name is Snarker on Azeroth, and my friends and I enjoy building towers. So much so, in fact, that we created Clan Towa with the unified purpose of spreading our love for these static defenses. We build towers of all shapes and sizes in both solo and team games, but usually prefer the arrow-spitting variants to their bulkier and more expensive cousins. If you ever do happen to catch us not building any during a game, it's probably a safe assumption that our account's been compromised.</p>
                    <p>Towers require little micro to operate, are very easy to queue up and mass produce, can be quickly repaired and rebuilt as needed, and offer little in the way of experience for enemy heroes. Most importantly, they do one thing that our clan has become very good at: pissing off the unsuspecting opposing team. In the competitive Warcraft scene, many bemoan the "unmannered" use of towers; human users are especially notorious for what some would call abusing the seemingly unassailability of massed towers, but often respond by arguing that towers are used with the intent to win and not for manner's sake.</p>
                    <p>We, as Clan Towa, build towers to have a good time at our opponent's expense.</p>
                    <p>The following report is both a commentary on an actual game itself and an outline of what has evolved into an almost textbook strategy designed to abuse certain terrain features of a specific map currently found in the 3v3 map rotation. Throughout the report, I will be including several articles that go in depth about a specific part of the highperch strategy, as well as various screenshots of comments from people we have played in ladder. I hope you enjoy my first battlereport.</p>

                    <p>Not all towers are created equal. Human towers come with three upgrades to their heavy armor, and are thus able to have a whopping +8 armor total. Orc towers are able to return damage to melee units as well as switch from heavy to fortified armor later in the game. Undead can upgrade any of their basic food-supplying ziggurats to a tower which can be unsummoned to regain a partial amount of its resource cost, and Night Elf towers can move and cannibalize nearby trees to regenerate its health.</p>

                    <p>Ideally, we would only mass orc and human towers. Undead towers are four times as big, have long build times and high costs, and require creep much like a sunken colony, making them not nearly as versatile on large maps. Ancient protectors require a wisp sacrifice, and this alone makes massing impractical.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the opposing army composition, we build a mix of guard and watch towers. Human towers with their heavy armor are excellent against bats, chimaeras, mortars, and all other forms of siege. Orc towers with their durable fortified armor can take the brunt of entire armies. They also have the highest range of all towers making them invaluable on elevated terrain, a very important fact to take note of as you will soon see. Most games require adaptation and thus our usual rule of thumb is if we find ourselves asking if we built enough towers, then we need to build some more.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Highperch is a 6-player map characterized by a top versus bottom parallel arrangement of starting locations for the two teams. Four additional expansions are arranged in a wide square around the map center, in contrast to other equally-sized maps where the expansions are close to a respective player and, hence, easier to defend. These four expansions are directly in the path of armies en route to an enemy base, and thus are a risky venture for anyone seeking additional resources through a second goldmine. There are two vertical land paths from the top of the map to the bottom, each with a progressive series of chokepoints that can be towered up somewhat easily.</p>
                    <img src="/static/images/guide/lizards.png" class="inright" title="Low-level lizards" />
                    <p>The lack of any high-level red creep camps suggests an easily-crept and expansion-friendly map dotted by numerous green and yellow camps, populated by lightning-spewing thunder lizards, bow and axe-wielding centaurs, and warthog-like razormanes. The thunder lizards have splash damage and can cast purge to make creeping difficult for any intelligence heroes relying on summoned units to soak up damage, the centaurs deal high rates of damage through their archers, and the razormanes can summon little piglets as well as cast healing ward. At the center of the map is a large clearing with a tavern; a mercenary camp sits to its left and a goblin shop to its right.</p>
                    <div class="clearfix"></div>
                    <p>The true anomalies of this map lie in the mountainous plateaus at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. Without any Goblin Laboratories on this map and from which no zeppelins to purchase, there is no direct way for land units to ascend these mountains. On the apex of each lies a fountain of health guarded by a green-level swarm of flying harpies.</p>

                    </div>				
                    <p>If one were to hypothetically mass towers upon this plateau (and only the right one, since the pathing is less weird and it has more room for towers), it would be unassailable by any forms of land siege. Air siege units such as chimaeras and frost wyrms are unable to rely on ground support when attacking this position, making them extremely vulnerable to various forms of anti-air air units. We still sometimes wonder why Blizzard's map creators even put them there, because there is neither easy access nor strategic value to these mountains.</p>

                <div class="cont">
                    <p>The first thing people always type when they discover our stronghold atop these mountains is "how'd you get up there?" Without purchasable zeppelins to carry our heroes and workers up the 5 or so levels of elevation depending on which side we approach it from, the answer may not be apparent at first.</p>
                    <img src="/static/images/guide/zep.png" class="inleft lightborder" title="No hot air balloon rides" />
                    <p>The most obvious answer is Warden with her blink ability. I'm sure you are all by now aware of the new Stalker unit in Starcraft 2, able to leap up and down cliffs despite being a ground unit. A Warden can easily clear the mountaintop with a few well-placed blinks and the aid of vision to clear the fog.</p>
                    <p>The next easiest way is to have a gargoyle or druid of the talon in crow form fly up to the mountaintop, have them transform into their land model, and have a hero use a staff of teleportation to warp onto the unit, since the staff can only be used on ground units. A hippogryph rider can also drop an archer to be teleported onto. But what if your team doesn't have a night elf or undead player? The remaining three solutions are subtle and somewhat tedious, involving one of three heroes: a Tinker setting up a pocket factory upon a higher elevation level for heroes to teleport onto, a Keeper of the Grove creating treants upon a higher elevation level for heroes to teleport onto, and a Beastmaster using a level 3 bear with blink for...well, I'm sure you can figure it out by now.</p>
                    <p>Believe it or not, there are actually at least three more ways of reaching the top (and no, a level 6 Archmage doesn't count since he needs a ground unit to teleport onto), but they would take such extraordinary measures that they could never be used practically in a highperch game. Can you think of what they could be?</p>

            <p><span class="yellow">welp.2ez</span> and <span class="teal">ugh.2ez</span> hire dual Archmages to blizzard harass the opposing team's workers, while <span class="green">cum.2ez</span> commands a Blademaster for the same purpose. Water elementals make a negligible impact during large team battles, especially on a map where all the green camps can cast purge to deal 400 damage to summoned units. AoE skills are far more critical when allied forces wholly consist of only heroes and towers defending against a mounting siege army. Blademaster and heroes like the Warden can whittle down enemy forces in long, drawn out tower games while possessing handy escape skills.</p>

These heroes are very army-centric, considering that the Priestess and Tauren wield two of the arguably best auras in the game. The unarmored huntresses, augmented by the Priestess's trueshot aura, can deal the majority of the damage while grunts bear the brunt of enemy forces.</p>
            <p><span class="blue">b1209irthday</span> sends a scout wisp in a counterclockwise fashion, passing <span class="green">cum.2ez</span>'s peon on its way to make the first of many towers, and soon sends his Priestess of the Moon towards <span class="green">cum.2ez</span>'s base. It spots the towers at the chokepoint on the right side, but before it can prevent their construction, is chased off by <span class="green">cum.2ez</span>'s Blademaster and <span class="yellow">welp.2ez</span>'s Archmage.</p>

                <div class="cont">
                    <p>All creeps are set to 'guard mode' and have a specific acquisition range (aggro). If a hero falls within that range, the creeps will chase to hit the hero, and continue hitting it until either dies. If the hero goes beyond that target range, they will still continue to chase/hit for three seconds before they make a 180-degree turn and head back to their original spot to 'guard'. This constant shifting between guard and attack modes means free hits by your units while the creeps are shuffling about. This method of creeping is a trade-off between having your units take less damage from more powerful creeps, and taking a longer time to kill the creeps from having to pull the creeps out, getting a few hits, then chasing them back to their camp to continue the cycle until the creeps die.</p>

                <div class="cont">
                    <p>An important rule of any tower game is to stay under fifty food early to avoid any penalties incurred from having too large of an army. This borrows heavily from the FFA mentality of hoarding as many gold mines as possible while staying under the minimum threshold for low upkeep. Both highperch and FFA games can last well over a hour, and it's crucial to have resources for the duration of the game. If the opposing team stays at high upkeep and loses their army, they usually will not come back from the game. Once the mountain has been successfully fully perched with several rings of towers, we can't help but laugh as our opponents throw waves upon waves of siege onto our tower shores at the two chokepoints.</p>

                    <p>Don't get us wrong, we know perfectly well that our tower defense will eventually crumble. There is little that even a dozen rows of towers can do against dragonhawks and chimaeras determined to break through. But for the past half hour the opposing team is usually over 50 food and losing gold in both upkeep and from replacing their losses, which is more than enough time for us to drain the gold from our expansions, build 50 food armies consisting of mostly anti-air air units, and play the waiting game atop our indomitable perch fortress high up in the clouds.</p>

                    <p>How essential is it to have an orc ally in a highperch game? Well, we wouldn't be able to tower on the mountaintop without one.</p>

                    <p>The key lies in the orc voodoo shop. Tiny great hall, a costly item that lets the orc player build a great hall instantly, also lets any allied player build the main hall for his respective race. Once a hero with a tiny hall teleports to the mountaintop, any hero can use a teleport scroll to bring workers along with any other necessary units up onto the perch without the aid of a zeppelin. A level 6 Archmage can teleport with workers to a druid of the talon or a gargoyle, but it's neither practical nor a sure thing. Thus, having an orc player is essential to proper perching.</p>
                    <p>On the topic of which racial town hall to build, there isn't that much room on the perch itself. We always try to build a tree if we have a night elf ally, simply because it is the smallest town hall and can eat trees to help clear the way for towers. If we don't have a night elf player, then we build a human town hall because of its upgradeable armor bonuses.</p>

At <time>1:15:00</time>, three more bats suicide themselves to kill a dragonhawk, and soon afterwards, <span class="pink">legd-milk</span>’s 10 remaining bats successfully eliminate all five of team <span class="gray">TOWA</span>'s dragonhawks.</p>
            <p>Fifteen minutes pass. The Blademaster finds two lone bears wandering about the lower-right expansion, and the Alchemist teleports along to try and slay them. However, the rejeuvenation skill of the bears, which heals a unit for 400 hitpoints over twelve seconds, proves too strong for both heroes to overcome before reinforcements arrive. Blademaster staffs out the Alchemist before being ambushed, and this is where <span class="green">cum.2ez</span> makes a huge error. The Blademaster uses a staff of teleportation on himself, which unlike a town portal doesn't make the unit invulnerable during the teleport animation. <span class="green">cum.2ez</span> does this before being entangled by a Keeper that he failed to see in time. Lacking any potions or mana for windwalk, the Blademaster quickly falls.</p>

            <p><span class="green">cum.2ez</span> now has to build two burrows and an altar in order to revive his slain Blademaster, while his team’s towers are getting picked off left and right by constant fly-bys from the ten chimaeras. Six minutes later the Blademaster is back on the ground, but team <span class="gray">TOWA</span> is down to just three watch towers and one arcane tower. There were originally over 40 towers on the perch; now's there's only four.</p>
            <p>For the next several minutes, the chimaeras make several more passes at the perch. In the process, they lose four of their number due to purges from the four heroes guarding the perch who all possess an orb of lightning. Alchemist, thanks to these kills, is now only one-fifth of a level away from level 6. It needs to kill pretty much all six of the remaining chimaeras to reach the next level, or a miracle…</p>
            <p>...a miracle that comes in the form of <span class="red">real331</span>’s level 7 Keeper. None of the players on team <span class="purple">GnH</span> has any gold left, and if one of their heroes were to die, they wouldn't have enough resources to revive it. <span class="green">cum.2ez</span>’s Blademaster spots the Keeper all alone south of their mountain at 1:47:00, and Alchemist quickly teleports along. The Keeper proves no match for a Blademaster with 150 damage critical attacks and a chemically enraged Alchemist. Alchemist reaches level 6, and <span class="pink">legd-milk</span> decides at this point to leave the game.</p>

            <p>The game really is over by now. The chimaeras are effectively neutered by the fear of being turned into gold, and <span class="blue">b1209irthday</span> is forced to kill off his bears to avoid having them be transmuted. Eventually, <span class="red">real331</span>'s chimaeras are picked off one by one, and team <span class="purple">GnH</span>'s three heroes can only huddle around the tree of life at the upper-right expansion, knowing that their time has come to an end.</p>

                <h2>Afterthoughts</h2>
                <div class="cont">
                    <p>The replay of this game can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>Some thoughts about this game and highperching in general:</p>
                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i>At a few points late in this game, team <span class="purple">GnH</span> could have won by getting a druid of the talon onto the perch for their heroes to teleport onto, considering they had a level 7 Tauren Chieftain backed up by tranquility, starfall, twin Keepers with entangle, and dozens of disposable chimaeras.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i>If you know the game will facilitate high level heroes, as tower games are prone to do, a level 6 Dark Ranger, Alchemist, or Blademaster will usually secure the win.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i>Against undead players with frost wyrms, build towers at least half a tower square apart. Freezing breath will freeze towers and all adjacent structures, so spacing them out will avoid this.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i>Build orc towers against magic, and human towers against siege. Use your judgment and build a healthy mix of the two.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>And some advice for people playing against towering teams:</p>
                    <ul class="fa-ul">
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i>A very fast grunt and fiend push can steamroll towers, and footmen are also terribly effective since defend makes them nearly invincible to tower fire. Huntresses aren't encouraged because they're unarmored.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i>We need something below the perch to teleport to, whether it's a mechanical critter, hidden tree of life, or a druid of the talon. You find these, and we can't do shit outside our perch.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i>We will probably use batriders and invisible mortars against your mains. How else do you expect us to win while turtling behind our towers? Expect this and properly defend against it.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i><b>Q</b>: How do you beat a turtling terran in Starcraft? <b>A</b>: You outexpand him. The same principle applies in tower games.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i>Make your base harass-proof against heroes like the Blademaster.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i>Don't go into upkeep! These are three hour long games; gold becomes very precious in the late game.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-circle-o"></i>When rushing a towering team early, don't attack the human base with its tough armor, towers, and militia. Try attacking the orc or night elf player first.</li>
